## To Do

* Keyboard
    * Add buttons for widening/narrowing keys
    * Add buttons for shifting keyboard left/right (just change which key is assigned as middle key)
    * Need to assign one key is the middle key and run a function to keep that key in the middle after translations
    * Just set margin-left on the keyboard container and the keyboard will shift accordingly.  Hide x-overflow.
* QWERTY keyboard
    * Probably add another seven notes by using the bottom row of keys and top row of numbers
    * Add a handle that can be dragged to slide which keyboard keys are assigned to the QWERTY keyboard
    * On pointer move, check which key LeftPos the left side of the handle is closest to
    * On pointer up, snap the handle to the nearest key
    * In future: clicking the handle allows switching between QWERTY and AZWERTY etc
